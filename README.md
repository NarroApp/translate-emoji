You know how sometimes you read English and it has all these non-word characters (emoji)? Yeah, `translate-emoji` fixes that.

## Usage
~~~js
var translateEmoji = require('translate-emoji'),
    testString;

testString = 'ðŸ“° I had a nice day at work! ðŸ‘©';

console.log(translateEmoji.translate(testString));
// (newspaper) Have a nice day at work! (woman)

console.log(translateEmoji.translate(testString, true));
// Have a nice day at work!

console.log(translateEmoji.containsEmoji(testString));
// true
